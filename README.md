## 🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – page structure

CSS3 – styling and responsive layout

JavaScript (ES6+) – burger menu, accordions, popup

Swiper.js – sliders for hero and content sections

## 💡 Potential Improvements

Refine responsiveness: Layout works on mobile, tablet, and desktop, but could be polished for edge cases (very large screens, landscape tablets, etc.).

Optimize JavaScript structure: Could be further improved with reusable patterns and clearer separation of concerns.

Accessibility audit: Basic ARIA roles and focus states are implemented, but a full WCAG-compliant audit would ensure the best experience for all users.

Optimize images: Use modern formats (WebP) and <picture> for responsive loading, and preloading for smoothness.

Add a build setup: Introduce Vite or Parcel for asset bundling, minification, and easier development workflow.
